The mlb.db file in this folder is a snapshot from when the original input csv is entered. It only contains the tables from the initial input.

As code is ran in the jupyter notebook, the mlb.db will be updated to the full product. The file was saved in this way to save space.

Also, running the last cell in the notebook will clear the mlb.db completely, which you can then run the notebook again and a new instance of the database will be created.
